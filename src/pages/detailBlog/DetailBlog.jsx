To crack the code for the UX copies, we at Zeta Design wanted to build a Figma plugin for the larger design community. The plugin is called the Ghost UXWriter and has a set of UX copies cataloged and categorized with a voice and tone variation ranging from plain, casual to playful. The intention to build this Figma plugin originated from our Medium blog post, â€˜Designing voice and tone for error messages.</p>
